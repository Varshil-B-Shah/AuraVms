Getting Started with Node.js in 2026

Node.js has revolutionized JavaScript development by enabling server-side programming. This guide will help you understand the fundamentals and best practices.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser. Built on Chrome's V8 engine, it's perfect for building scalable network applications.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous & Event-Driven**: All APIs are non-blocking
- **Fast Execution**: V8 engine compiles JavaScript to native code
- **NPM Ecosystem**: Access to over 1 million packages
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Getting Started

First, install Node.js from the official website. Then create your first server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello World!');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

## Best Practices

1. Use async/await for cleaner asynchronous code
2. Handle errors properly with try/catch
3. Leverage environment variables for configuration
4. Follow the Node.js style guide

Node.js continues to be a top choice for backend development in 2026!
